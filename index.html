        Hello, my name is Ron Wazny, and I have been designing or creating things my whole life.
        I have always found new ways to keep myself motivated to be creative, whether it is at work or at home.
      
        Anything from painting a guitar, to making a funny christmas postcard to share with family and friends. 
        This is a portfolio of some of my work, both professional and academic. I hope you take the time to browse around and see a few of my works.

        My mission is to continue to grow and develop as a graphic designer using my skills in all genres of design and web development
        I'm looking forward to growing and taking on new and exciting roles!
